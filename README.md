# Stock tracker

Course-work project for Udemy course "Flutter & Dart: The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller of Academind. The idea was to build a proof-of-concept for how to use a proper API to back up a stock tracker app like harbour-watchlist using a  personal API key, to provide better data. Mostly this has been about learning Flutter, so far.
